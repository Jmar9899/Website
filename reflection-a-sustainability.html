      <p class="sub" style="margin-top:0;"><strong>Apply principles of sustainability to create viable systems</strong></p>

      <h2 class="h2">Critical incident</h2>
      <p class="small">In a façade scope early in design development, the project team was under pressure to lock in a compliant system quickly so procurement could begin. The initial concept met immediate functional requirements, but it relied on a material and detailing approach that would likely drive high waste during fabrication and future replacement cycles. The tension was familiar: time and cost pushed toward “what we know works today,” while sustainability required us to consider the full life of the asset, including embodied impacts and maintainability.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Professional significance</h2>
      <p class="small">This incident mattered to me because sustainability is not an abstract ideal; it is a practical performance requirement that must coexist with real constraints. Sustainable development is commonly framed as meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs (World Commission on Environment and Development [WCED], 1987). In façade engineering, that definition becomes concrete: system choices affect energy use, replacement cycles, waste streams, and durability outcomes across decades. I also recognise sustainability as a professional obligation. Engineers Australia explicitly links engineering practice to creating solutions for “a sustainable future” (Engineers Australia, 2020).</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Feelings and reactions</h2>
      <p class="small">I felt a strong responsibility not to let the programme pressure reduce the decision to a narrow first-cost outcome. At the same time, I felt the practical anxiety of proposing change: any alternative had to remain buildable, compliant, and deliverable within the project’s schedule and budget. I was also aware of reputational risk—if I pushed sustainability without evidence, I could lose trust. That tension forced me to treat sustainability like any other engineering requirement: define criteria, test options, document trade-offs, and communicate clearly.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Actions taken</h2>
      <p class="small">I responded by reframing the discussion from “preference” to “system performance,” using lifecycle thinking as the structure for decision-making. ISO 14040 describes life cycle assessment (LCA) as a framework for evaluating impacts across a product system’s life cycle (ISO, 2006). While a full LCA was outside the time available, the principles were still useful. I documented a short list of measurable criteria—durability risk, replacement feasibility, expected waste, and buildability—and used these to compare two feasible system paths.</p>
      <p class="small">To make the sustainability component legible for non-specialists, I anchored the conversation in embodied carbon and circularity. WorldGBC argues that embodied carbon needs coordinated action across design and delivery, especially early in the project where key decisions are made (World Green Building Council, 2019). I also used circular-economy language—designing for maintenance, reuse, and reduced waste—as a practical way to describe what “better” looked like (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, n.d.).</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Outcome</h2>
      <p class="small">The team agreed to adopt a revised approach that preserved compliance and buildability, but improved long-term viability by reducing avoidable complexity and making replacement/repair more realistic. The result was not perfection, but a measurable improvement: clearer documentation of assumptions, fewer “single-point” proprietary dependencies, and a design direction that supported maintainability and reduced future waste. Equally important, the decision was transparent—stakeholders could see why the option was chosen and what would be monitored during delivery.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">How this informs future action</h2>
      <p class="small">The key lesson is that sustainability becomes achievable when it is engineered: translated into criteria and tested against constraints. In future projects I will: (1) establish sustainability criteria early (embodied carbon drivers, durability, circularity); (2) document assumptions and boundaries so the decision can be audited; and (3) use a structured comparison method (such as MCDA) when multiple viable options exist, so the discussion remains evidence-led rather than opinion-led.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">About</h2>
      <p class="small">I have many years of experience in design, beginning with industrial product design, expanding into architectural design, and now specialising in structural engineering with a focus on buildings and façades. I am drawn to engineering that delivers practical solutions and measurable performance improvements, while treating sustainability as a delivery objective.</p>

      <h3 class="h3">Current focus</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>In my current full-time role, I design and engineer building and façade structures with a strong emphasis on sustainable practice and real-world constructability.</li>
        <li>I am completing a Master of Professional Engineering (UTS) and preparing a graduate thesis on optimising façade systems for sustainable building performance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="h3">Research direction (graduate thesis)</h3>
      <p class="small">My thesis reframes façade and external-screen design as a measurable, performance-driven practice. It applies a unified multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework that evaluates options across Energy, Comfort, Reliability, Maintainability, and Circularity, under shared constraints such as climate, orientation, glazing ratio, and control logic.</p>

      <h3 class="h3">What I do</h3>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Façade system design and documentation (curtain wall, window wall, windows, sliding doors).</li>
        <li>Structural engineering of façade components and interfaces.</li>
        <li>Façade thermal modelling and simulation to support performance decisions.</li>
        <li>Weatherproofing and compliance thinking for Class 2, 3 and 9c buildings.</li>
        <li>Remedial, diagnostic and risk-focused assessments (including combustible cladding related scopes).</li>
        <li>Tendering, project management and delivery support across stakeholders.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="h3">Professional accountability and ethical conduct (remedial/diagnostic façade work)</h3>
      <div class="kv"><div class="k">Action</div><div>Verified site conditions against records; documented assumptions/limitations; separated facts from interpretation; outlined further investigations needed.</div></div>
      <div class="kv"><div class="k">Result</div><div>Enabled stakeholders to make informed decisions with clear understanding of risk, scope boundaries and duty of care.</div></div>

      <h3 class="h3">Cross-discipline communication (architecture–structure–fabrication–installation)</h3>
      <div class="kv"><div class="k">Action</div><div>Led coordination discussions using clear mark-ups and visual explanations (including 3D-style presentations and shop documentation) to make trade-offs visible.</div></div>
      <div class="kv"><div class="k">Result</div><div>Accelerated decisions and reduced misunderstandings by aligning technical and non-technical stakeholders.</div></div>

      <h3 class="h3">Innovation and proactive improvement (factory/site constraints)</h3>
      <div class="kv"><div class="k">Action</div><div>Developed engineered improvements such as production data processes, factory optimisation approaches, logistics/packaging strategies, and specialised components (e.g., lifting clamps, safety products).</div></div>
      <div class="kv"><div class="k">Result</div><div>Improved delivery quality and practicality by converting recurring constraints into repeatable solutions.</div></div>

      <h3 class="h3">Information management and traceability (documentation-heavy delivery)</h3>
      <div class="kv"><div class="k">Action</div><div>Produced/reviewed shop and production drawings; managed procurement and sizing workflows; prepared inspection reports, proposals and as-built reviews with disciplined revision control.</div></div>
      <div class="kv"><div class="k">Result</div><div>Maintained a reliable source of truth that reduced ambiguity and supported evidence-based decisions.</div></div>

      <h3 class="h3">Performance management under pressure (consulting practice)</h3>
      <div class="kv"><div class="k">Action</div><div>Prioritised by risk and deliverable criticality; set weekly milestones; communicated constraints early; sought feedback to improve delivery.</div></div>
      <div class="kv"><div class="k">Result</div><div>Sustained momentum and reliability while protecting quality and accountability.</div></div>

      <h3 class="h3">Teamwork and leadership (principal façade engineer)</h3>
      <div class="kv"><div class="k">Action</div><div>Defined interfaces/deliverables; supported team members with practical guidance; led resolution when decisions or risk calls were required.</div></div>
      <div class="kv"><div class="k">Result</div><div>Improved confidence and progress through shared plans, fewer interface gaps, and clearer accountability.</div></div>

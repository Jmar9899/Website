      <p class="sub" style="margin-top:0;"><strong>Professional practice within intercultural and global contexts</strong></p>

      <h2 class="h2">Critical incident</h2>
      <p class="small">Early in my façade career, I worked in an international environment where design intent, fabrication practices, and site expectations were shaped by different cultural norms and professional backgrounds. A recurring challenge was coordination at interfaces: what one party treated as an “assumption” another treated as a “commitment.” In one case, a misalignment in how stakeholders interpreted a drawing note led to a disagreement about responsibility for a performance risk. The technical issue was solvable, but the real risk was relationship breakdown and decision paralysis.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Professional significance</h2>
      <p class="small">This incident was professionally significant because it showed me that engineering competence is not only technical; it includes the ability to work effectively across cultures, disciplines, and power structures. Deardorff (2006) frames intercultural competence as involving attitudes, knowledge, skills, and internal/external outcomes—meaning effective performance depends on both what we know and how we behave in context. In professional practice, this connects directly to ethical duties: Engineers Australia expects members to demonstrate integrity, communicate honestly, and act in the public interest (Engineers Australia, 2020). When communication fails, ethical practice is at risk because decisions become less transparent and accountability becomes blurred.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Feelings and reactions</h2>
      <p class="small">At the time, I felt frustrated because the technical facts seemed clear, yet progress was blocked by misunderstandings and differing expectations. I also felt cautious: pushing too hard could be seen as disrespectful or could escalate conflict. Looking back, I recognise that my initial reaction was shaped by my own “default” communication style—direct, problem-focused, and fast. The incident made me more aware of the need to adapt without losing technical clarity.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Actions taken</h2>
      <p class="small">I shifted from debating positions to building shared understanding. First, I separated facts from interpretation (what is observed vs what is assumed) and made the decision points explicit. Second, I used visual communication—mark-ups, simple diagrams, and step-by-step interface descriptions—so that meaning did not rely on implied context. Third, I checked understanding by asking each stakeholder to restate the agreed scope and responsibilities in their own words.</p>
      <p class="small">With hindsight, what I was doing aligns with cultural intelligence (CQ): the capability to function effectively in intercultural settings (Earley & Ang, 2003). CQ is not “being nice”; it is being intentional—adapting communication, verifying assumptions, and recognising that different teams may interpret the same message differently. Deardorff’s (2006) model also helped me later to name the skills involved: curiosity, respect, and the discipline to verify mutual understanding before committing to action.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Outcome</h2>
      <p class="small">The immediate outcome was that stakeholders could agree on a practical path forward: clarify the interface scope, document responsibilities, and define the next verification steps. More importantly, trust improved because the process was fair and transparent. The technical work progressed faster once everyone could see the same problem definition and the same decision logic.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">How this informs future action</h2>
      <p class="small">This incident changed how I approach intercultural and global practice. I now treat cross-cultural coordination as an engineering risk that needs controls. In future work I will: (1) establish shared definitions early (scope, roles, quality criteria); (2) use redundancy in communication—written notes plus visuals; (3) confirm understanding explicitly; and (4) document decisions so accountability is clear. These actions support ethical practice because they reduce ambiguity and help teams make defensible, well-informed decisions (Engineers Australia, 2020).</p>
